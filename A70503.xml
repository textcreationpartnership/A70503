            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE condition of thoſe in the Text, both for what they had been once, and for what they now were, that is, for their ſtraying and returning again, looks ſo like our caſe of late, (who, if ever any, had err'd and ſtray'd from all the wayes of duty both to God and man, but are now happily returned to the Shepherds and Biſhops of our Souls) you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps imagine this Text to be choſen of purpoſe to purſue thoſe two <hi>Blown Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54149:3"/>
            <p>And therefore before I proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will be neceſſary to deliver you from thoſe thoughts, and perhaps that fear. For though the miſchiefs in the one, &amp; Bleſſings in the other be ſuch, as deſerve never to be forgotten; yet poſſibly may not indure a perpetual importunate Remembrancer.</p>
            <p>And the truth is, the very words and phraſe of the text, which onely at the firſt bluſh carries us upon thoſe thoughts, will leave us, if we look a little nearer to them. For the Straying here will prove to be of another kind, and the Return will be found to be to another Biſhop. The ſtraying here was of ſuch as had err'd like Sheep, whereas ours had little or nothing of the Sheep in it, ſave the Sheeps clothing; for dreſſ'd up they were with pretenſes as ſoft as wool, Gods glory, Purity of worſhip, Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nothing worſe then theſe, and ſo indeed they err'd like Sheep, as if they had been ſuch; but the truth is, it was liker the ranging of Wolves, tearing and devouring, then the ſtraying of weak
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54149:3"/>and ſilly Sheep. And for the returning likewiſe here, though it was to a Biſhop, yet I dare not be ſo bold with him that bears that name in the text, directly to apply it to our Biſhops, nor advance our return to this.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop here was no doubt our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, whom God himſelf had conſecrated and ordained to that office; but our Biſhops are not otherwiſe concerned here then as they can make their title from and under him; but if that may be done hereafter, I truſt you will not be againſt it. In the mean time, if there were no more in it, me thinks this ſhould be enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to the name of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which our Saviour himſelf hath vouchſafed to take upon him. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid aſide that argument, which the words at firſt ſight ſeem'd to offer, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak your attention to one of a more common intereſt, which concerns all that would be Chriſtians, whoſe chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter it is. Who from the wayes of ſin and error, are return'd to the faith and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54149:4"/>obedience of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who to reduce us from thoſe wayes hath taken upon him to be our Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
            <p>The main point is, that God of his mercy complying with the neceſſities &amp; infirmities of nature, hath erected an office of truſt and confidence in his Church, under the quality of a Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to direct and guide us, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would erre and ſtray like ſheep, and ſo be loſt for ever. The particulars incident to this are, firſt The neceſſity of it, impli'd in our natural condition, who like Sheep are of themſelves apt to erre and go aſtray. 2. The accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation we have for it. For what ſhould they do which are out of the way, but return? and to whom ſhould Sheep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn but to a Shepherd? and loſt Sheep, but to him that came <hi>to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt?</hi> and where ſhould they finde ſo ſafe and ſure a retreat, as in him who purchas'd them with his own blood? All theſe are accompliſhed in our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54149:4"/>we ſhall conſider, firſt in his office of Shepherd or Biſhop; then in his Flock or Dioceſs; the Souls of men. <hi>We are returned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> THe firſt thing we meet with in the text, is our natural condition. That we were as Sheep that had gone aſtray. And the confeſſion of this is the firſt thing we meet with in our Liturgy. <hi>We have erred and ſtray'd like loſt Sheep.</hi> And though it were fit and neceſſary it ſhould be there, for, ſure I am, we never err'd worſe then ſince we laid that by; yet here we look upon it in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and uſe; it is the firſt ſtone to be laid in this building, in the erection of the office of a Shepherd and Biſhop. The infirmities of the Sheep are the ground of the neceſſity of a Shepherd.</p>
            <p>But now that while we are ſpeaking of our errors, we do not commit one, we muſt know, firſt what kind of erring this is, and then how we fell into the fatal neceſſity of it. What it is, the Biſhop that muſt lead us out of it, will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54149:5"/>tell us; for he is the Biſhop of our ſouls: and therefore our Straying here muſt be that of the Soul. For though our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral infirmities do expoſe us to error in many things elſe, yea almoſt in all other things, even thoſe that are within the reach of ſenſe and reaſon: there is not any thing in Nature, in Art, in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, though commonly received for truth, which of late time is not charged with error, and it may be ſometimes not without cauſe; yet without any great regard here, if the Soul be not concern'd.</p>
            <p>Now if we be ſo liable to error in the things of this life, where both the end and the way to them are within the compaſſe of the eye, in which we erre, as it were, in our own Country, where we are bred and born; we muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly loſe our way, where we are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, being Citizens of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as thoſe bleſſed Saints, who beſt knew the wayes of the ſoul, confeſſed, that they were <hi>ſtrangers and pilgrims</hi> here. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14. And they which ſay
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54149:5"/>ſo, ſhew plainly that they ſeek a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that a better, that is, a heavenly, where God hath prepared for them a City. They muſt needs be diſappointed that ſeek for Heaven upon earth, where there is nothing ſitted and proportion'd to the Soul, either for the nature or the deſires of it. The Soul is immortal, and cannot be provided for, where all things are liable to change and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for when it ſhall ſurvive them, it will be at a loſſe, till it ſind a Country like itſelf, that is everlaſting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
            <p>And as the nature, ſo the deſires of the Soul are unſatisfied here; the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the ear with hearing, nor the underſtanding with knowledge, nor the heart with the beſt and choiſeſt delights of it. We are ſoon wearied and tir'd with what we have, and are as thirſly of that we have not. In our plenty as craving, as others in their greateſt wants. The goods of this world are Hydropick all, <hi>quo plus bibun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur plus ſitiuntur.</hi> They that have the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54149:6"/>greateſt ſhare and portion in them, of Wealth, of Honour, of Power, do not ſleep the better, nor are their bodies leſs comber'd with diſeaſes, nor their minds freer from vexations and troubles. And therfore us the Saints I nam'd before, did by what they willingly ſuffer'd here, ſhew plainly that they ſought another Country; ſo by this is ſhewn as plainly, that they had cauſe to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Now here lyes the fatal neceſſity of erring, they ſeek a Country and City that is inviſible and unknown to nature, either what the ſtate of that Country is, or by what laws the Citizens thereof are to be governed. And when we walk in the dark it is not ſtrange we ſhould loſe our way.</p>
            <p>A chief part of that way lyes, firſt in the knowledge &amp; worſhip of that God, who had prepar'd for them a City, by what Sacrifices, Rites &amp; Ceremonies he will be ſerv'd. How much of that may be had by nature, we learn by thoſe, who were moſt likely to know, but did not, who were the maſters of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54149:6"/>to moſt other Nations, for of ſuch S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. Who when they profeſs'd themſelves to be wiſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> as well they might in many other things, yet in this of Gods worſhip, they became fools. For they <hi>turned the glory of the uncorruptible God, into the ſimilitude and image of corruptible Man, and of birds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.23.</note> 
               <hi>and fourfooted beaſts, and of creeping things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The right way of worſhipping God (ſince reveal'd to us to be by Jeſus Chriſt) was not only unknown to them, but to thoſe to whom God had more peculiarly imparted himſelf. <hi>The myſterie of Chriſt Epheſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>in other ages was not made known to the Sons of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>untill he was reveal'd unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by his Spirit.</hi> Yea it was unknown to the very Angels, who when it was firſt reveal'd, in a kind of admiration and curioſity <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>deſir'd to look,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> the word ſignifies <hi>earneſtly to pry into.</hi> And that which the Angels of Heaven did not know, certainly the ſons of men could not.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54149:7"/>
            <p>The other part of the way to that heavenly Country in which we may na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſeem to have ſome ſkill, the way of vertue, that is, in the ſtile of Scripture, to <hi>live godly, righteouſly and ſoberly in this preſent world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> appeared to the very Heathen to be the only way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet theſe natural impreſſions were ſo dim and imperfect, both through Original corruption, and the over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of paſſion and luſt, that of thoſe things they knew, they held the truth in unrighteouſneſs, even to the very perverting of the courſe of nature as the Apoſtle obſerves of them in the ſame place,<note place="margin">Rom 1.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Beſides, many vertues they knew not, which are the glory of Chriſtianity, as Humility, Denying ourſelves, Taking up the Croſs, Forgiving and Loving our enemies, in their eyes looked more like follies then vertues, and ſo they would have done in ours too, if we had had no better guide then ourſelves to lead us.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſee the neceſſity we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54149:7"/>have of Leading; let us now ſee the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation we have for it in the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, a perſon every way fitted for the purpoſe, both for his skill, and good will; He knew beſt the Heavenly Country, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are going, and the way to it; for he came from thence, from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his Father And for his good will to his own, we cannot doubt they are the Sheep which he had purchaſed with his blood, and by that had a juſt title to govern in what Lordly way of Secular domination he pleaſed; yet choſe that eaſie gentle way as Shepherds uſe to lead their Sheep And ſuch he profeſſed himſelf to be. <hi>I am the good Shepherd:</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 10.11.</note> 
               <hi>the good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep,</hi> and He made it good in every point while he was upon earth; He went about doing good, preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, healing the diſeaſes of the Sheep, forgiving their ſins, till he came to the laſt and hardeſt work of a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, He laid down his life for his Sheep.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54149:8"/>
            <p>Yet his Paſtoral care died not with him. As he was a Prieſt for ever; ſo he was a Shepherd for ever; for after he had in perſon aſcended into Heaven, he took care for his flock that he left behind Him, that they might not be as Sheep without a Shepherd.

            <p>To the Apoſtles it may be all this was allowed, but not therefore to all other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54149:9"/>Shepherds after. Yes, to all that can rightly claim from Him.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> His promiſe was to be with them to the end of the world, that is, longer then any Apoſtle could live. I am ſure the neceſſities of the Sheep will be the ſame for ever; for Sheep we ſhall be ſtill whereſoever we are. When God diſtributed to the Church the ſeveral parts of the Paſtoral charge, <hi>ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ 4.</note> 
               <hi>ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> he adds, that it was <hi>ad conſummationem Sanctorum, &amp; aedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem corporis Chriſti,</hi> that is, ſo long as there ſhould be Saints to be perfected, and ſo long as Chriſt ſhould have a Church, a body upon earth, and that is ſo long as there ſhould be Sheep Chriſt had provided there ſhould be Shepherds. And theſe he hath taken to that nearneſs and conjunction, that the obedience or contempt done to them, he takes it as done to himſelf. <hi>Qui vos audit me au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The benefits and advantages we have by this are many; firſt, it is an honour and incouragement to the Shepherds,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54149:10"/>that the work they do is Chriſts, who will bear them out in what they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their duty, and reward them for what they ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It removes all diſcouragement from the Sheep, that make a ſtand at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and frailties of their Shepherds, that they look through and beyond all them at the power of Chriſt under whom they ſerve.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another great benefit it is, that in all doubtful and difficult caſes we may ſecure our ſelves upon the conduct of Chriſt in his Miniſters. For if poſſibly men ſhould be miſled by them into error, when in ſimplicity of heart, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to the contrary, they ſhall ſubmit to them; I dare promiſe them at leaſt a favourable hearing from him that commanded the obedience.</p>
            <p>But I dare not, nor can ſay that for all Shepherds; for every congregational herd hath their Shepherd too, but ſuch as have no part in that power, which is derived from Chriſt and his miſſion; that gave it immediately to the Apoſtles
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54149:10"/>only. <hi>Sicut miſit me Pater, ſic &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 20.</note> And all others that have it muſt receive it from them, or from ſuch as derive it from them by ſucceſſion. It is but reaſon that Chriſt ſhould have the choice of his own Miniſters. The Sheep that belong to thoſe other Shepherds, can plead no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for their obedience to them, St. <hi>Pauls obedite praepoſitis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> belongs not to them, they obey not thoſe that are ſet over them, but either thoſe that ſet themſelves over the flock, or the flock themſelves ſet them, and that not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which ſome vainly plead for them; but as neceſſary, profeſſing there is no lawful calling for a Miniſter, <hi>quem non miſit populus,</hi> where the Shepherd is not choſen by the Sheep. If theſe fall into an error by the miſguidance of their Shepherds, they are in a ſad and worſe condition, which admits no plea of excuſe or extenuation from the Shepherd. They muſt bear their own faults, and the miſguiding of the Shepherds, which they make their own by chooſing them. In a word, the favour that Chriſt doth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54149:11"/>is to his own, not the peoples Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> THE next thing that falls into our conſideration is our Duty. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Chriſt the Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls. And that is to ſubmit our ſelves to be led and guided by him. To turn to Chriſt is in effect to turn Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. We are no leſs concerned here. And that muſt be in two reſpects: in his office of Shepherd and Biſhop, and in the execution of it by Shepherds and Biſhops.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> For firſt, we can not be ſaid to return to him as a Shepherd, if we refuſe him in any part of his office <hi>The good Sheep</hi> ſaith our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 10.27. <hi>hear the voice of the Shepherd and they follow him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 10.27.</note> If they turn their ears only to him, and hear him, and not follow him, they turn ſhort, for follow him they muſt through all the parts of his office. 'Tis ſo with us, who for the moſt part like nothing in the Shepherd but his pipe, and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant tune. His rod and his ſtaffe we can
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54149:11"/>ſpare. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribes us right, <hi>chap.</hi> 33. an old humour it ſeems it was. <hi>They come unto thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek 33.31.</note> 
               <hi>and ſit before thee as my people to hear my words, v.</hi> 31. juſt as we do here come and ſit us down as the Lords people to hear his word. But what follows in the next verſe? <hi>And loe thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 32.</note> 
               <hi>and can play well on an Inſtrument; for they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy words, but do them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what will come of this at the laſt, our Saviour tells us in the Parable, where ſome had the boldneſs to plead for their entrance,<note place="margin">Luke 13.26.</note> that they had <hi>eat and drunk in his preſence,</hi> and had <hi>heard him in their ſtreets. Citizens</hi> it ſeems they were by the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and by their <hi>devotions,</hi> a <hi>Sermon and a Dinner,</hi> they eat with him, and they heard him. But what came of it? by hearing him tis like they knew him well; for all that, he tells them plainly, He knew not them. If the Sheep wanted nothing but knowledge, I ſhould pardon them if they deſired nothing of the Shepherd but a Sermon. But this is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54149:12"/>not that which I principally intended here.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> But ſecondly, That our turning to Chriſt be in the full execution of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as in perſon, ſo by commiſſion. Princes, as well they may, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contemned in their Embaſſadors &amp; Miniſters. And ſo doth our Saviour for his Shepherds, who are his Miniſters and Embaſſadors too. <hi>Qui vos ſpernit me ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not incloſe this power or favour to Biſhops only, becauſe I finde that name in the text; but lay it in common to all ſuch to whom Chriſt hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under him the government of the Church and the cure of Souls; ſo as <hi>Presbyterians</hi> may have a ſhare here, when they can prove their Ordination and Miſſion.</p>
            <p>This part of our duty to obey Chriſt in his Miniſters is with many of very hard digeſtion, who not regarding the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there is of it, nor the benefit we have by it, nor the authority and commiſſion we have for it, nor the gentle conduct
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54149:12"/>we have in it, lay it aſide as a thing of no uſe, and that God hath provided other means to lead us many and more certain then any Shepherds can be. We have firſt our own <hi>Reaſon</hi> to lead us:
<list>
                  <item>2. We have <hi>Scripture</hi> a ſurer guide then that.</item>
                  <item>3. We have the <hi>Spirit</hi> beſides, and that <hi>will lead us into all truth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note>
                  </item>
               </list> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have our own <hi>Conſciences,</hi> which in the commiſſion of Leading is of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> nothing can be done without it.</p>
            <p>We can not deny but that all theſe have a part and ſhare in the guiding of our ſouls. But as no one of them doth exclude or bar the other; ſo nor do all of them the Shepherds. For allowing to every of theſe that which is peculiar to them, there will be ſtill found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to remain, which is proper for the Shepherds to do.</p>
            <p>I am now, I confeſs, in a diſcourſe not ſo ſmooth and eaſie as beſt befits po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Sermons; yet becauſe many whom it concerns to weaken the hands and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Church-governours, do with their importunate clamours ſill the Pulpit, you
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54149:13"/>will be pleaſed to allow of a ſhort An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from thence too.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ANd firſt for REASON; It is not to be denied, that it ought to be admitted even in matters of Religion, where it hath leaſt to do; for Religion is the object and imployment of Faith, and not of Reaſoning, &amp; yet naturally no man will believe any thing unleſs he ſees Reaſon for it. But how? not a Reaſon of the thing that he beleives; for that works Knowledge, nor Faith; but yet a reaſon of beleiving it, for the credit of the author that relates it; for nothing can be more unreaſonable, then not to beleive God that cannot lye. But to admit reaſon in matters of Faith for any other uſe then that, is to ſet up a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without Faith, which would be as ſtrange a thing as to have a Religion with nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>There are in Religion ſome things to be known as well as believed, and to theſe Reaſon and Diſcourſe is proper; for though the Articles of Faith, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54149:13"/>whatſoever ſhall appear to be contained in Scripture are without all doubt and reaſoning to be received, becauſe God hath revealed them; yet that this or that Article or Propoſition is contained in Scripture, is a thing to be known, and lyes within the compaſſe of ſenſe, we may ſee whether it be there or no, that is, for the words. And for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe words we muſt underſtand the language in which they are written, the proper import and idiom of the phraſe, the force and conſequence of the diſcourſe, the coherence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it hath with other points better known. We muſt beſides diſcover the fallacies &amp; inconſequences of thoſe that would obtrude a different ſenſe from that we receive. All theſe difficulties, though in matter of Religion, are within the conduct of Reaſon; but it is Reaſon ſo exalted with skill of Arts and Languages, with Prudence and Diligence, that we ſhall be forced to find work for the Shepherds too. The greateſt part of Chriſts flock, I am ſure, muſt periſh if they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54149:14"/>may not truſt others in thoſe things, to which their natural inabilities or courſe of life hath made them incapable. And for the beſt of the flock, whom both Nature and Art hath fitted to maſter the greateſt difficulties of themſelves; if they ſhall ſeriouſly conſider how much and how oft Prejudice, Education, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Paſſion and Intereſt doth corrupt our Reaſon, we would in prudence ſometimes ſuſpect our own, and ſeek better ſecurity from the Church; where though we ſhall not infallibly ſind the truth, we may alwayes ſafely preſume it. This will ſerve to reconcile our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> THe next pretender againſt the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds leading is the SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE. I confeſſe the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be a ſurer guide then Reaſon, for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſake; and yet, by what ye heard even now, it works little without it, but yet ſurer for all that. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Scripture is a cauſe of erring. <hi>Ye erre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22.29.</note> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>not knowing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54149:14"/>the Scriptures.</hi> And to keep us right in our way Gods <hi>Word is a lantern to our feet,<note place="margin">Pſalm 119.105.</note> and a light unto our paths.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay too much of the excellency and beneſit of it. It is a perfect record of all that concerns Heaven, or the way to it. It hath all the perfections that a law or rule can have to guide us; yet thoſe perfections are confin'd within the limits and nature of a law, to do no more then is proper for a law to do, which is very little without a Judge to apply it. Though the rule be ſufficiently ſtraight and perfect, yet it meaſures nothing out of the hand of him that hath skill to uſe it. Bring what controverſy you will to the lawes, they pronounce nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Plaintiff or Defendant. This is the true reaſon why, though all ſects pretend to Scripture, there is yet no end of controverſies, becauſe there is no common Judge to end them. And the reaſon why every ſect for all that ſeems to reſt ſatisfied, they are guided by the Scripture, is becauſe they carry their Judge along with them, themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54149:15"/>
            <p>So as if together with the Scriptures there be not a Shepherd too, or ſome as little to be truſted, our ſelves I mean, it cannot lead at all. It is indeed a <hi>two-edged ſword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> but cuts nothing, but in the hand of him that uſeth it.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> A Third pretender to avoid the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds is the SPIRIT. That without queſtion will lead us into all truth.<note place="margin">John 16.13.</note> But for the manner of the <hi>Spirits</hi> leading the Scripture points out two ways.

               <hi>i.e.</hi> as it led the Prophets of old, by reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the truth and matter of the Propheſy, the object. And by this way it led all the Apoſtles, to whom the whole doctrine of the Goſpel, and myſtery of ſalvation by Chriſt was reveal'd. And thus <hi>holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.21.</note> To this way of leading none can pretend, that doth not prove his commiſſion from God by a miracle, who ſends none of ſuch an errand that cannot make it appear
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54149:15"/>ſome way, that he came from him. If the <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> would have his dreams believed to be the dictates and revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit, let him ſhew his letters of Credence from Heaven ſeal'd with a miracle, and I ſhall not doubt to ſet him above all the Doctors and Shepherds of the Church. Otherwiſe he may deceive himſelfe by his ſpirit, he ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</p>
            <p>The other way of the <hi>Spirits</hi> leading is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> not by revealing any thing to us, but by co operating with us, by fortifying the ſoul &amp; the faculties of it, to all ſupernatural actions, by aſſiſtance of grace to inlighten the underſtanding to comprehend divine truth, to inflame the affections with the love of it, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our indeavours in all difficulties and temptations. To this aſſiſtance of the Spirit all the faithful have a right. And though in this way the Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive us, yet we may be deceived in it, becauſe it never works but with us; if we fail in what we are to do, then that fails us.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54149:16"/>
            <p>And by this way not only private perſons, but publick Councells are gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. To whom the Spirit doth not reveal the matter of their Decrees <gap reason="foreign">

This is the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſtrongeſt fort againſt Obedience. If he can get his Conſcience about him, he thinks himſelf ſo ſafe that he may bid defiance to all Authority.</p>
            <p>In the Commiſſion of leaders, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, as I ſaid, the Conſcience to be of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> We are to do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and much leſſe againſt it. But then we muſt be ſure we miſtake not ſomewhat elſe for the Conſcience. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſeaſe and diſtemper of the mind, cauſeleſſe ſcruple, ſlight perſwaſion, groundleſſe fear is not the Conſcience, againſt which we are bound not to act.</p>
            <p>The tender <hi>Conſcience,</hi> for which ſo much favour is pleaded, may prove in ſome no better then a diſeaſe of the Soul, a ſpiritual Splene. For though it be good to be tender of offending God in any thing where it proceeds from the good temper and conſtitution of the ſoul, which is the ſame conſtantly in all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54149:17"/>caſes, and is not affected or taken up for a purpoſe, as the ſturdy begger carries his arm in a ſtring, that it may be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to beg and be idle.</p>
            <p>You may know it certainly to be a diſeaſe if it comes upon us by ſits and ſtarts, as to be tender of offending God when we obey men, and not to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of offending God when we diſobey them. If they be not an tender of one ſide as of another, as I never find them to be, it is but a Paralitick Conſcience that is dead of one ſide. For tell him the Church commands it, he preſently ſhrinks and ſtartles at it; and well ſo, for poſſibly he may ſin againſt God. But tell him on the other ſide that God commands obedience to thoſe that rule over us, it moves him not at all, you may thruſt a needle into his ſide and he feels it not. It ſhewes plainly the Conſcience hath a dead Palſy on that ſide.</p>
            <p>But a right and ſound Conſcience againſt which certainly we ought not to act, is a conſtant and well governed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54149:17"/>judgement; for not to amuſe you as the manner is with frivolous diſtinctions and definitions of Conſcience, in this caſe the Conſcience is nothing but every mans private judgement; for he ought not to attempt the doing of any thing, till he hath framed this judgement to himſelf, that it is lawful for him to do it. Now ſeeing our private judgement hath ſo great power and influence as to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the courſe of publick, it had need be a true and regular judgement. As firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> It muſt not be arbitrary, for that we think we have reaſon to decline in the publick Magiſtrate, to govern by Will and not by Law. Many a Conſcience if it were well examined, will prove to be nothing but will, not judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Every good judgement is upon a full hearing of the cauſe of both ſides, all evidences duly weighed and examined, then reſolves; this is a Conſcience againſt which we ought not to act, though poſſibly it might prove to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; yet for all that we muſt know
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54149:18"/>that it doth not ſet us free from the guilt of diſobeying our Governours. And then this is all the benefit our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will do us in caſe of error, that it caſts us into a neceſſity of ſinning, by obeying againſt our ſelves, by diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt our Governours. We ſhall do well therefore to take care, that we make not every ſlight perſwaſion, doubt or ſcruple, a Conſcience, truſting to be diſcharged of our obedience by that, which indeed binds it faſter upon us; for that is the very end and benefit for which is inſtituted the Paſtoral charge, that when we are ſo weak we can not ſafely truſt our ſelves, we may rely upon that: unleſs we think it a good plea, I am blind and therefore I will not be led. I am weak and ſickly, and therefore I will not be rul'd by the Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>Now to ſumme up all, if not <hi>Reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> will diſcharge us of the duty we owe to the Church, in the name of God, let us not raſhly fling away ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54149:18"/>that in all our doubts and fears, for our quiet and ſecurity, we may have recourſe to the Shepherds and Biſhops of our Souls.</p>
            <p>THis is the laſt point, the Shepherds Flock or the Biſhops Dioceſſe: the Souls of men. And here we meet with another quarrel from the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> That they may be ſure to ſpoil the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of all authority, they take away their Dioceſſe, the cure of Souls, that they may be Biſhops <hi>ſine titulo;</hi> for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops they are not either of our bodies or eſtates. And why not of our Souls? Chriſt indeed the great Shepherd that purchaſed them may rule them, but they are too precious for any other Shepherds to Lord over: which they ſay is done by binding the Souls with Church-laws and cenſures, which Chriſt hath ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And thus they ſet up Chriſt againſt himſelf, and Chriſtian liberty againſt Chriſtian duty.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I confeſs doth earneſtly preſs this point of liberty,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>Stand fast in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54149:19"/>wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not intangled again with the yoak of bondage.</hi> But what liberty? It is not ſimply from obedience either to men or Laws, for that were deſtructive to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society as well as Religion. What then is it? It is no more then that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have a liberty not to be Jews. I dare be hold to ſay, this is all that can be made of it. And the reaſon why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo earneſtly preſs it is evident. The Jews that were willing enough to entertain the doctrine of Chriſt, yet were not ſo eaſily drawn to part with thoſe Rites and Ceremonies, to which they had been ſo long accuſtomed, and upon ſo good authority. To humour theſe <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his Diſciples ſet up a medley of both Religions, that they might be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> too. Againſt this doctrine St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets himſelf, eſpecially in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galations.</hi> If they have taken upon them to be Chriſtians let them ſtand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that, and not look back again to the fleſh having begun in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54149:19"/>Spirit. <note place="margin">Gal 3.3.</note> For behold, I <hi>Paul ſay unto you, if ye be circumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note> To claim from hence liberty from any other men or lawes then the Jews, they might as well ſay Chriſt hath here given them liberty not to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. For Chriſtians we cannot be, unleſs we obey the Lawes and Government of thoſe that Chriſt hath ſet over us. To uſe our liberty in this caſe our Apoſtle in the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged it to be no better then a <hi>cloak of malitiouſneſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And for thoſe Conſciences which are ſo tender that every Church-law pinches and galls them, they do without relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance binde their own Souls. Every private man can do that which we will not indure the Church ſhould do. He that promiſeth any thing is bound in conſcience to perform it, though before he took that bond upon him he had his Chriſtian liberty not to do it. Before <hi>Anunias</hi> promiſed to ſell his eſtate, and give it to the Church, he was free, St. <hi>Peter</hi> told him ſo;<note place="margin">Acts 5.4.</note> 
               <hi>Was it not in thine
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54149:20"/>own power?</hi> Yet after that it was not in his power to make uſe of that liberty; for his conſcience was bound. And if a promiſe may do this, much more a vow or an oath. <hi>If a man vow a vow unto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 30.2.</note> 
               <hi>or ſwear an oath to bind his Soul,</hi> Numb. 30.2. (the Soul may be bound) <hi>he ſhall not break his word, he ſhall do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man ſhould be ſo unreaſonable as to ſay, his conſcience may be bound by himſelf, but not by any elſe. Do not they themſelves, as their manner is in their Sermons, bind over their hearers to anſwer for them at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and what a heap and load of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons muſt then ly upon their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? though the truth is, they bind none but themſelves, and that to repent for corrupting Gods Word, and miſleading the people into Faction, Sedition and Diſobedience, to ſay no worſe.</p>
            <p>Let us ſeriouſly conſider and compare that which they would avoid, with that which they indeavour to ſet up in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54149:20"/>room of it. They would avoid firſt the power of the Church in her Laws and Cenſures as a domineering over mens conſciences, and a lording it over Gods inheritance. But if they look upon it with an impartial eye, they ſhall find all contrary, nothing but moderation; as firſt in the very ſtile of the Church, that there might be no harſh words. The laws by which they govern, are not call'd laws but canons, that is, rules to guide, rather then force.
<list>
                  <item>2. Church-puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not call'd <hi>poenae</hi> but <hi>cenſurae,</hi> not that they are ſweetned with good words only, but with real benefit; for they are not as temporal puniſhments <hi>ad vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam</hi> but <hi>ad diſciplinam,</hi> for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not revenge of ſin.</item>
                  <item>3. The temporal judge, if not Soveraign, cannot pardon the felony though he would. The Eccleſiaſtical judge cannot but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don though he would not.</item>
               </list>
               <hi>Eccleſia non claudit gremium redeuntibus,</hi> is a rule in the Court Chriſtian. The Church refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth none that will return and repent. There is no ſuch rule in ſecular Courts,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54149:21"/>that the thief or murtherer upon repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be pardoned. And by Church-Canons in elder times it was deemed an irregularity to be preſent at a ſentence of blood. Not that it is a crime to be ſo, but as the Canon ſpeaks, <hi>propter defectum lenitatis,</hi> that nothing in them might ſeem to be of harſhneſs or cruelty. The higheſt and moſt terrible of all Church-cenſures, of which men ſeem to be moſt impatient, how harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and gentle is Excommunication? If he be not guilty, <hi>clavibus errantibus,</hi> he is never the worſe for it; the bonds fall off of themſelves; if he be guilty, he may be the better for it if he will. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> judged the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> to be delivered unto Satan,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.3.</note> and this was thought to be Excommunication &amp; ſomewhat more; yet this was for his benefit, for <hi>the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit might be ſaved in the day of our Lord Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> verſe 5. What is there in all this that ſhould fright us from our obedience?</p>
            <p>But now let us ſee what on the other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54149:21"/>ſide they would ſet up in the room of this. A liberty of Conſcience, forſooth, from the fetters of laws, that they might not ſerve God in bonds like ſlaves, but freely. That they may preach what they will, and as long as they will. That they may pray how they will, and faſt when they will. That they may ſtand and kneel where and when they will. Indeed a true arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Will-worſhip; inſtead of a lawful orderly ſerving of God, a confuſion of all.</p>
            <p>But they hold themſelves wrong'd to be charged with will-worſhip, for that they do all by Reaſon and the Scripture and the Spirit. Yet for all that pretenſe they are ſtill under that charge; becauſe all theſe are at their own wills; what ſectary is there that with a wet ſinger cannot, nay doth not challenge Reaſon, the Scripture, the Spirit and Conſcience to be for him, when he will?</p>
            <p>And why do they allow theſe to guide them and not the Shepherds, but becauſe theſe are at their beek and will, but the Shepherds are not? And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54149:22"/>they cannot command them, they would be rid of them, that ſo they might without control Lord it as they will.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall trouble you no longer with our Shepherds or their Adverſaries, but for a concluſion and caution reflect upon our ſelves: for though Chriſt hath comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cure of our ſouls to others, he hath not taken it from ourſelves. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds were given for a help to eaſe us in it, not to eaſe us of it. Every one may and muſt be by a concurrent care a Shepherd and Biſhop to himſelf; and then here I ſhall take leave only to put you in mind of your Dioceſſe, your Souls, that ye be not our Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.15.</note> that we miſtake not our Cure; for there be other things we have as great affection for as our Souls, I wiſh we had not. The rich glutton in the Goſpel, when he ſaid to his ſoul, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt much goods laid up for thee &amp;c</hi> ſure he miſtook his body for his ſoul,<note place="margin">Luke 12.19.</note> for there was nothing in his barns that could feed that. This is no greater an error and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54149:22"/>then we dayly commit our ſelves, to go no farther then this preſent time. <hi>Lent,</hi> if there were any thing left of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us but the name, charges the ſoul by prayer and faſting to ſit and prepare it ſelf to meet our Lord at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When we plead our conſtitution and bealth againſt it, it ſhews we are no ill Curates of our bodies, whatſoever we be of our ſouls.</p>
            <p>Yea that which hath a better title to be our ſouls will not lie within this Cure; the intellectual and principal part of the ſoul, and the inriching it with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Arts and Sciences, ſpeculative and practick, by which all our affaires, and the greateſt of all the affaires of the world are governed, which imploy the ſouls beſt vertues and indowments, and for which none but great &amp; noble ſoules are ſit. Yet this is not the ſoul for which Chriſt died, and is to be our Cure. For when we have gained this and all the world beſides we may loſe our ſouls. The Holy Ghoſt takes no other notice of theſe then as if they were but bodies, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54149:23"/>indeed for their continuance they are no better, for they periſh with our bodies; the greateſt wits and wiſeſt conduct lie buried in their duſt with them, not will they appear again for us in that world where the ſoul is moſt concern'd. In a word, the Scripture owns no loſing or ſaving to the ſoul but in that condition which muſt live and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever. Nothing is worthy that name that is not immortal. Yet I muſt recal my ſelf when I ſaid theſe mortal ſouls, that is, in their temporal condition, are not within our Cure; to get, it may be not, but to uſe they are. The meaneſt of them all our Saviour expreſly commits to our charge, <hi>Make you friends of unrighteous Mammon, that they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 16.9.</note> Things everlaſting are proper for the ſoul. And if you ſhall make you friends likewiſe of your honours, powers, and knowledge, for the advantage of Gods honour and ſervice, certainly they will do as much for you as <hi>Mammon</hi> can. For thus theſe mortals do put on immortality, theſe corruptibles do put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.54.</note> You may in this ſenſe make a ſoul out of your bodies by the chaſt, ſober and temperate uſe of them. And ſo our bodies and all elſe become the proper Cure of our ſouls, and in the diſcharge of that care, we may expect the bleſsing of good Shepherds as well as that of good Sheep. And <hi>when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a crown of Glory that ſadeth not away.</hi>
